# Spi Calculus Implementation in Coq
This repository contains a preliminary implementation of the spi calculus in the Coq proof system, created for my master's thesis.  Feel free to use it if you're interested for some reason.  Please give credit if you use anything contained within for anything major.  The Sets and NewVar files must be compiled as .vo files in the same directory as the main workfile for it to work properly.
